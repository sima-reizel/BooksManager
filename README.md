Clone the repository

## sever

2. run npm install
3. run node server.js
4. You will get:
  - Server is listening on http://localhost:4000
  - Connected to MongoDB
  - collection books is created
  - collection authors is created

## client
1. Enter in the command line to client
2. run npm install
3. run npm start

### At fisrt you will see an empty page it will be filled only after you will add books in the AddBook tab.
### Before you add bookes you must have Authors in your author table.
### If you dont have authors you can add authors in the AddAuthor tab.
### Now the image will work well only if you will have select an image from the public file. (Includes images for both the AddBook tab + AddAuthor tab).
### You can copy images to the public folder or use the current images.
### I know that I have to fix this issue.
